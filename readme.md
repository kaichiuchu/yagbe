## Introduction

yagbe ("Yet Another Game Boy Emulator") is a Game Boy emulator with a somewhat
uncharacteristic goal: very high levels of portability. To that end, yagbe is
written in ANSI C and should compile on virtually any C compiler and operate
on virtually any platform. If yagbe fails to do either one or those, please
open an issue and it will be investigated.

## Supported frontends
