## Introduction

yagbe ("Yet Another Game Boy Emulator") is a Game Boy emulator with a somewhat
uncharacteristic goal: very high levels of portability. To that end, yagbe is
written in ANSI C and should compile on virtually any C compiler and operate
on virtually any platform. If yagbe fails to do either one or those, please
open an issue and it will be investigated.

## Supported frontends

 - SDL2

## Building

yagbe tries to support all of the known compilers.

There are many ways to build yagbe, this is entirely dependent on your
environment.

If you wish to use CMake, it must be between versions 3.7 and 3.22.
